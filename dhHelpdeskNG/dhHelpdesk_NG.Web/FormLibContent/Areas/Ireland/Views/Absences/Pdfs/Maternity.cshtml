            Dear @Model.GetDocumentAnswer("FirstName", true),<br />
            <br />
            Thank you for giving me your notification of pregnancy form and your medical certificate confirming you are pregnant.  I am now in a position to confirm your entitlement to maternity pay and maternity leave.
            <br />
            <br />
            You are entitled to 26 weeks Ordinary Maternity Leave and 16 weeks Additional Leave giving a total of 42 weeks leave.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is for you to choose when you want to stop work and return to work however the latest you may choose to start your maternity leave is:  2 weeks before the end of the expected week of childbirth and the earliest you can return is 4 weeks after the end of the expected week of childbirth.
            <br />
            <br />
            In your letter you stated that you wish to start your Ordinary Maternity Leave on @Model.GetDocumentAnswer("AbsenceStartFrom" + Model.MultiNr, true).  You may change this date but would need to give us 28 days notice of the original date or the new date, whichever is earlier.
            <br />
            <br />
            Taking the @Model.GetDocumentAnswer("AbsenceStartFrom" + Model.MultiNr, true) which is when you want Ordinary Maternity Leave to begin this will mean you will be due to return to work on @Model.GetDocumentAnswer("AbsenceEndsOn" + Model.MultiNr, true). If you wish to return earlier than this date then you must give 4 weeks written notice. <strong>(There will be no further correspondence from us regarding your return date)</strong>.
            <br />
            <br />

            As part of our risk assessment procedures, IKEA keeps under review and health and safety risks to pregnant co-workers; you are also responsible for your own health and safety and should take care to avoid any undue risks.  If you have any immediate concerns please discuss these with your manager.
            <br />
            <br />
            On a more personal note, I hope everything goes well with the preparations for the new arrival and I am sorry I have to make this letter so formal.  We have agreed that the HR department will keep in contact with you during your leave ensuring you are kept up to date with the store news and tertials/nights out.
            <br />
            <br />
            We look forward to hearing news of the birth and seeing you and your baby once you are able to visit.  If for any reason you want to contact me for further advice then please do not hesitate to do so.
