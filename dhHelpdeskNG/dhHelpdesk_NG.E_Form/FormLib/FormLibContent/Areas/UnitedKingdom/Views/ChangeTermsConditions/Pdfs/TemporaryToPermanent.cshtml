            <br />
            8.	Upon termination of your employment, you will normally be entitled to annual holiday with pay, or pay in lieu thereof, proportional to your length of service.

            <br />
            9.	If it is agreed your probationary period is extended beyond your first six months’ then your notice period will remain as one week from either side.
